# Path

# Amend the path for specific programs, environments, etc. Path amendments are
# usually associated with either a class of binary (local, local system, etc.)
# or are associated with a specific program/language (e.g. packaging systems).

PATH=$PATH

# On MacOS (and probably some *nixes), /etc/profile is sourced after .zshenv,
# wiping out PATH definitions set here. The path_helper utility on MacOS
# should instead be used to manage modifications to the PATH.

if [[ `uname` != 'Darwin' ]] then;

   # Local Binaries (/usr/local/bin, usually managed by Homebrew)

   PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

   # Local System Binaries (/usr/local/sbin, some programs use it)

   PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin
